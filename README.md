## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to create a background for different media queries.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.pic{
    width: inherit;
    border-top-left-radius: 13px;
    border-top-right-radius: 13px;
    background-image: url(https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qROtzqKQpFOOuLHOeRShVKRk5Z1XrJ5jZ2nBlx8IqtZ6PHNGku4zmD3ro9KMb0sywsg=w2400);
    background-position: center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    height: 40%;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [Background image Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_background.asp) to learn more.

### Continued development

How to make a page reponsive using flex and grid.

### Useful resources

- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp) - This helped me with centring the background image so that it could cover its give space.
